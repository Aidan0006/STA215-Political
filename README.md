# STA215-Final-Aidan M
My replication package for my STA-215 final project. I recorded the opinions of TCNJ students on numerous political (or political adjacent) topics. I sought to analyze if there were any correlation between trust or affiliation between specific organizations and groups.
## **Instructions**
To access and utilize the script, open the "STA215-Politics" file, which contains the code for my project. To access the dataset, open the "raw_data Aidan McIlmurray - Sheet1-2.csv" file.
## **Data**
The data collected was from anonymous TCNJ students who answered a google form made by us. The main overaching goal of the analysis to see if students within the same college shared the same political opinions, or if they differed drastically from one another. I analyzed level of trust in journalists, medical professionals, the average american, and the level of support in patriotism and the two major political parties.
## **Operationalization**
To operationalize level of trust in journalists, medical professionals, and the average american, participants were asked how often they would put their trust into these groups. Answers ranged from "Never", "Rarely", "Some of the time", "Most of the time", and "Just about always" to assess this level of trust among TCNJ students.
